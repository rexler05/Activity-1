                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>As someone passionate about animals, I wanted to create a space where people could find pets that truly match their lifestyles and needs. I've always believed that a pet can bring endless joy to a home, and I wanted to make it easier for both pets and families to find each other.</p>
